            <h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT name">.MRS.MARCHMONT</h6>  <p class="MRS_MARCHMONT speech">Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

<h6 class="LADYBASILDON name">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="LADYBASILDON speech"> suppose so.  Are you ? I</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="MRS_MARCHMONT speech">Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

<h6 class="LADYBASILDON name">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="LADYBASILDON speech">Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.</p>


<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT name">MRS. MARCHMONT. </h6> <p class="MRS_MARCHMONT speech">I come here to be educated.</p>

<h6 class="LADYBASILDON name" >LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="LADYBASILDON speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="MRS_MARCHMONT speech">So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.</p>

<h6 class="LADYBASILDON name">LADY BASILDON.</h6> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] </p> <p class="LADYBASILDON speech">I don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT name" >MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6> <p class="MRS_MARCHMONT speech"> How very trivial of him!</p>

<h6 class="LADYBASILDON name">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p class="LADYBASILDON speech">Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>

<h6 class="MRS_MARCHMONT name">MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p class="MRS_MARCHMONT speech">About myself.</p>
