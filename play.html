        <h4>An Ideal Husband</h4>
        <h5>ACT II.  _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_.</h5>
        
            MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?

<h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p> suppose so.  Are you?</p>I

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

<h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I</p>
go anywhere.

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT. </h6> <p>I come here to be educated.</p>

<h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
here to try to find one.</p>

<h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6> <p> [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.] </p> <p>I don’t see
anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.</p>

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6> <p> How very trivial of him!</p>

<h6>LADY BASILDON.</h6>  <p>Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>

<h6>MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  <p>About myself.</p>
